COVIDâ€‘19 transmits when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. 
The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in
the air and travel over longer distances,particularly indoors.
